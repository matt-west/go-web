# Go-Web

A simple template based website framework.

## Instructions

Add page html files to the `/pages/` folder.
Create an entry for the page in `/data/pages.json`. This allows you to set the slug, title, keywords and description.

## Notes

There is no 'CMS' and there never will be. They restrict you too much and I don't like them, so no.

Yes, you could use PHP to acheive the same result but PHP doesn't rock like GO does.
