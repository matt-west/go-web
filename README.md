# Go-Web

A simple template based website framework.

## Instructions

Pages go in the `/pages/` folder.

## Notes

There is no 'CMS' and there never will be. They restrict you too much and I don't like them, so no.

Yes, you could use PHP to acheive the same result but PHP doesn't rock like GO does.
